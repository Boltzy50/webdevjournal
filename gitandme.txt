Git is a modern version control system, and GitHub is a repository hosting tool. Git is optimized for performance, it is a very strong tool for committing changes, merging, and comparing past versions of files. GitHub is really great because it allows you to work remotely with many people on one project, and each person can push and pull separate parts of projects independently. When you use Git and GitHub together, they are very strong tools that allow you to work with others and make changes to files and programs very efficiently.
