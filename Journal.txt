	Now that I know what to expect with class, I am more excited than ever to learn more.  While I am still a bit nervous, a lot can feel overwhelming at first; I feel that I can really do this if I put my mind to it.  Starting this path is something I contemplated for a while, and now that I have committed I am very excited.

	 At the end of the class, I hope to be confident enough with my skills to find a job and grow my expertise from there. If I could find a job in the field within 6 months of class ending, I would be extremely happy. Within 1 year I hope to have found that job and to have gotten comfortable using what I have learned in that environment.
	I need to stay on top of my work and make sure I finish things on time to be successful.  It has been a while since I have been in school, and it's a change of mindset. At this point I think I've done a good job of getting back in to the habits, but I still have room to grow. As my instructor, to help me towards success I just would hope you keep doing what you've done. You're very helpful and you take the time to explain anything we may be confused on.
